# A Gene Regulatory Network Approach to Cellular Persistence in S. cerevisiae

This repository contains the source code and data for the Master's Thesis titled "A gene regulatory network approach to cellular persistence in *S. cerevisiae*".

## Abstract

Cellular persistence is a phenomenon where a subpopulation of cells transiently tolerates lethal drug doses, posing a major clinical challenge. This non-heritable form of drug tolerance is thought to arise from the stochastic nature of gene expression. We hypothesized that expression noise drives key regulators across critical thresholds, leading cells into a drug-tolerant state. To test this hypothesis, we employed an *in silico* approach. First, persistence-candidate genes were selected from single-cell proteomics data. Next, we analyzed a state-of-the-art *S. cerevisiae* Gene Regulatory Network (GRN), identifying its key architectural features. Finally, the network's dynamics were simulated using a Boolean model under both proliferative and quiescent conditions. The system consistently converged to a single, condition-specific attractor, showing no evidence of stable phenotypic heterogeneity. This result refutes the idea that persistence corresponds to an alternative stable state in this framework. However, we observed complex and extended transient dynamics en route to the quiescent-state attractor. This suggests that persistence may not be a stable attractor but rather a long-lived, noise-driven, non-equilibrium state.

## Project Description

This project is divided into two main analytical parts:

1.  **Topological Network Analysis**: This involves the structural characterization of the *S. cerevisiae* Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) to understand the framework that governs information flow and cellular dynamics. We analyze local properties (e.g., degree distribution, clustering) and global features (e.g., bow-tie architecture, functional communities).

2.  **Dynamical Simulation**: This part implements a threshold Boolean model to simulate the network's behavior under different environmental conditions (rich media vs. starvation). The goal is to investigate whether the model can generate the phenotypic heterogeneity required for persistence by searching for multiple stable states (attractors).

## Installation

To run the analyses, you will need Python 3.8 or higher. Using a virtual environment is recommended.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jaimemartinezcazon/S.-Cerevisae-Gene-Regulatory-Network-as-an-approach-to-cellular-persistence
    cd S.-Cerevisae-Gene-Regulatory-Network-as-an-approach-to-cellular-persistence
    ```

2.  Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

We divide the scripts into two categories:

---

### 1. Topological Analysis (`Topology` folder)

This folder contains scripts for various topological analyses:

1. Clustering analysis  
2. Degree analysis  
3. Modularity analysis  
4. Null model construction  
5. Assortativity analysis  
6. Bow-Tie structure  
7. Centrality measures  
8. Filtering disconnected components from the original GRN  
9. Input TFs analysis  
10. Network load reproduction from the original paper  
11. GRN visualization  
12. Reciprocity analysis  

All scripts operate on a filtered edge list representing the GRN used in this study.  
To generate it:
- First, transform the original paper’s data into an edge list using script **10**.
- Then, filter disconnected components using script **8**.

Some scripts require additional data generated by others in this same folder.  
In particular, scripts in folder **4** (Null models) are essential to generate the null model set used for comparison in surrogate data topological analysis.

### 2. Dynamical Simulations (`Dynamics` folder)

This folder contains Boolean simulations of the GRN, focused on attractor dynamics and basin analysis.  
Two update rules are presented:

#### Rule 1 – **Simple Majority Rule**
Nodes are updated based on whether the influence of their regulators equals or exceeds a **global threshold** (same for all nodes).

#### Rule 2 – **Degree-Proportional Threshold Rule** *(Not used in this work)*
Each node’s threshold is **proportional to the number of its regulators**.  
This approach assumes that nodes with more regulators (e.g., hubs) are harder to activate.  
However, we do **not** use this rule in our study because:
- It assumes that more regulators always imply a higher activation threshold.
- This is not biologically generalizable. For example, a gene could be strongly inhibited by a **single** regulator, regardless of how many others exist.
- Biological processes are typically non-linear, so using the simplest possible model is often the best approach.

### Future Directions – Rules to Explore

#### **Rule with Hysteresis**
Biologically inspired hysteresis with two thresholds:
- To deactivate an active node: input ≤ *w−*
- To activate an inactive node: input ≥ *w+*

This adds memory to the dynamics and reflects more realistic biological switching.

#### **Rule with Stochastic Noise**
Two types of noise could be incorporated:

1. **`TF_prob`** – Probability that a node with `k_in = 0` (i.e., a transcription factor not regulated by others) changes state.
   - This is not "noise" in the usual sense, but models **unknown regulation**.
   - This probability could be tuned per TF.

2. **`noise_prob`** – Probability that any node changes state randomly due to regulatory noise.
   - Could be adjusted based on node degree or other features.
   - Separate probabilities could be used for:
     - **OFF → ON** transitions
     - **ON → OFF** transitions
   - Activating a normally inactive node (ON state) should typically have a **lower** probability, reflecting biological cost.

#### **Threshold Fluctuation Noise**
Rather than injecting noise into node states, noise could affect the **threshold values themselves**, making them dynamic.  
It would be interesting to compare:
- Direct noise on node states vs.  
- Noise on regulatory thresholds.



## Data Sources

-   **Gene Regulatory Network (GRN):** The network is a state-of-the-art reconstruction for *S. cerevisiae* from [Jackson et al. (2020), *eLife*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/51254).
-   **Candidate Gene Proteomics Data:** Candidate genes were selected from single-cell proteomics data available in the [YeastRGB](https://www.nature.com/articles/nchembio.2147) and [LoQate](https://www.jcb.org/content/200/6/839) databases.

## Key Findings

1.  **Single Attractor per Condition:** The deterministic Boolean model converges to a single, globally dominant attractor for each simulated environment. It does not produce the stable phenotypic heterogeneity required to explain persistence as an alternative cell state.
2.  **The Importance of Transients:** The convergence to the quiescent attractor is significantly slower and more heterogeneous than the convergence to the proliferative state. This suggests that persistence could be a long-lived transient state within a rugged dynamical landscape, rather than a fixed attractor.
